Project reflection
Joshua Lasley

Sprint 1: Not much was done, a very well thought out and planned project propolsal should help us create this game, one of the big chalenges looking ahead would to be saving your score and other things along those lines. We started making the character. Along with the backgrounds and sprites for the game alotouhther. Also started creatig the enimes.

Sprint 2: I tried to finsh the enimes along wih other things and trying to keep everyone on task that would stay on task. We didn't gte to much done this sprint. But stuff like the chaning levels asspect and other things like that have now ben implemneted.

Sprint 3: I was very unlocked for this sprint and didn't really help to much at all. Most of what happned in this sprint was Grason, and him being locked in on fixng my mistakes and just over all bugs in the game and he also focused on making the game more effeiant.

Sprint 4: Started to lock in during this sprint and statred to do my job a little more. Started working on oter things. One of the big chalenges was still scaroe but Grason ahs an idea for it.

Sprint 5: The score has been trying gto be implented and he has started and finsihesd kind of a name system as well which makes us even closer to svaing scores. We also started on a new wepon ad added muliplayer.

Sprint 6: Overall I wasn't here much this week because I had ap testing but a lot of finsihin touches were added to the game to not only put it all toghther but to make it more efficaint.
